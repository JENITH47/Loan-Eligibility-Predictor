# 🏦 Loan Eligibility Predictor

This project is a **Loan Eligibility Predictor** built using machine learning in a Jupyter Notebook. It predicts whether a loan applicant is eligible for a loan based on their financial and demographic profile.

## 📚 Overview

Banks often face the challenge of identifying which applicants are eligible for loans. This ML model automates that decision-making process.

- ✅ Preprocessing real-world data
- 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- 🧠 Model training and evaluation
- 🔍 Predicting loan status (`Y` / `N`)
- 💡 Visual insights into feature impact
